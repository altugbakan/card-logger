## Features

### Adding Cards

You can add cards to your collection using the `[A]`dd menu. Use `[enter]` to add the card, or `[ctrl+z]` to undo your change. The syntax is `<collection> <card number> [pattern]`.

You can also optionally enter a `<collection>` first, and just enter `<card number>-[pattern]` after. If pattern is omitted, the default pattern is used.

### Listing Cards

You can list what cards you have using the `[L]`ist menu. You can select a set with `[enter]`. Within a set, you can select a pattern to add with `[a]`, or remove with `[d]`. You can move around using the `[arrow keys]`, or even `[page up]` and `[page down]`. You can also use `[/]` to search for a set or a card.

On the list menu, you can view which cards you are missing using `[m]`. You can move around using the `[arrow keys]`, and use `[/]` to search for a card. You can `[t]`oggle between cards you are completely missing, or cards you have missing patterns for.

### Backups

You can create a backup of your database using the `[B]`ackups menu using the `[s]`ave button, which will be saved in the `./backups` folder. If the tool detects an unsaved change in the user cards, an backup is saved automatically (max 10). You can `[l]`oad a backup by selecting one and pressing `[enter]`.
